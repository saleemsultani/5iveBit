        'NIST CSF is based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices; thus, it is designed to be consistent with various security requirements, such as ISO 27001, CIS Controls, and industry-specific regulations.',
        'While the framework is voluntary, its widespread adoption within the critical infrastructure sectors has made it the basis of many cybersecurity programs throughout the world.',

        'Detect: Allow timely discovery of cybersecurity events through continuous security monitoring, anomaly detection, and threat hunting. Detection processes are implemented along with the detection systems and are kept updated.',
        'Respond: Design and implement activities to support the detection and response to cybersecurity events, such as response planning, communications, mitigation, analysis, and improvements.',
